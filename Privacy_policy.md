# Privacy Policy (Overview)

This document summarizes how the Secure Contacts app ("we", "our", "the App") collects, uses, and shares user data. It is written to meet common requirements for both the Apple App Store and Google Play (Android). For the full website-hosted policy.

By default, all user data (contacts, settings, and app metadata) is stored locally on the device in a Realm database. The App does not upload your contacts to our servers. The App includes an optional backup feature that, if enabled by you, creates encrypted backup files and lets you upload them to your own cloud storage account (Google Drive on Android or iCloud Drive on iOS). We do not access your cloud drive on your behalf; backups are stored in your account.

If you need a localized or legally binding version for a specific jurisdiction, please refer to the hosted policy above or contact us (see Contact section).

## What information we collect

- **Contacts**: With your permission the App may access your device contacts to import or secure them inside the app. We only access contacts you explicitly allow.
- **Account information**: If you sign up or link an account (email address, display name) to use cloud backup or sync features, we store the account identifier and associated metadata needed to provide the service.
- **Device & usage data**: We may collect anonymous analytics and diagnostic data (app version, crash logs, usage events) to help improve the App.
- **Backups / Attachments**: By default backup files and attachments are stored locally. If you choose to create cloud backups the App will upload the encrypted backup file to your selected cloud storage (Google Drive for Android or iCloud Drive for iOS). Backups contain the contact content you choose to include.
- **No sensitive Health data by default**: The App does not collect health information unless you explicitly enable a feature that requires it; any such collection will be clearly disclosed and consented to.

## How we use the information

- To provide core app features (storing, securing, and restoring contacts).
- To enable optional features you enable: backup, sync, or attachments.
- To respond to your support requests and to communicate important notices.
- To analyze and improve the App (aggregate and anonymous analytics).

## Sharing and disclosure

- We do not sell your personal information.
- We do not store your contact data on our servers unless you explicitly enable a feature that requires it (for example, a cloud backup option that uploads to your own cloud storage). When you upload backups, those files are stored in your cloud account.
- We may share limited data with third-party service providers who perform services on our behalf (e.g., analytics providers). Those providers are contractually restricted from using your data for other purposes.
- We may disclose information to comply with the law or protect rights.

## Permissions (Android & iOS)

- The App may request permissions for:
  - Contacts: required for importing and managing contacts.
  - Storage / Files & Media: for creating local backups or attaching files.
  - Camera or Microphone: only if you explicitly enable a feature that uses them; otherwise not used.

When a permission is requested, the device will display a system prompt. You can revoke permissions at any time in your system settings.

## Data used to track you (App Store / Play Store disclosure)

- The App does not track users across apps and websites owned by other companies for advertising purposes.
- We use analytics that collect aggregated, non-identifying usage data. This data is not used to build a profile for advertising.

## Data linked to you

- The following types of data may be linked to your identity if you create an account or enable cloud features: Contacts (the contact records you store), Account info (email), and Backup files.

## Data not linked to you

- Aggregate analytics and crash reports are collected in ways that do not directly identify you.

## Retention and deletion

- We retain data as long as necessary to provide the service or as required by law.
- To delete your account and associated data, follow the in-app account deletion flow (if provided) or contact us. Deletion requests will be handled per applicable law.

## Security

- We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect data. Sensitive content such as backups or contact data may be encrypted on-device before upload if you enable that option.

## Children

- The App is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under applicable age limits. If you believe we have collected data from a child, contact us to request deletion.

## International transfers

- Your data may be stored or processed in the country where our service providers operate. We will protect data in accordance with this policy and applicable laws.

## Your rights

- Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights to access, correct, or delete your personal data, or to restrict or object to certain processing. Contact us to exercise these rights.
